/**
 * Instance methods in inheritance are overridden.
 * Class methods are only shadowed. There is no dynamic behaviour.
 * The actual type doesn't matter only the declared type.
 * E.g. A a = new B()
 *      a.staticMethod() means always A.staticMethod() even if B.staticMethod() exists.
 * 
 * Rules for overriding:
 * 
 * 1) Access modifiers and overriding
 * - An overriden method must not be more restrictive (e.g. public -> protected -> default -> private). 
 * - The default is more restrictive than protected.
 * 
 * 2) The method throws a checked exception
 * - Can throw the same checked exception or the sublcass of this checked exception.
 * - Can throw no exception
 * - Can throw extra runtime exception
 * 
 * 3) The method doesn't throw checked exception
 * - Cannot throw checked exception
 * - Can throw any runtime exception
 * 
 * 3) Runtime exception
 * - No rules for that. You can declare, omit etc.
 * 
 * 4) Return type is covariant.
 * - E.g. super return with Object and child with String
 * - Before Java 5.0, when you override a method, both parameters and return type must match exactly. 
 *   In Java 5.0, it introduces a new facility called covariant return type. 
 *   You can override a method with the same signature but returns a subclass of the object returned. 
 *   In another words, a method in a subclass can return an object whose type is a 
 *   subclass of the type returned by the method with the same signature in the superclass.
