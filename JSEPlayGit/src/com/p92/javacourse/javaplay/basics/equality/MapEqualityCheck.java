 /**
  * Example for equality and hashcode management in Maps.
  * 
  * 
  * When // public int hashCode() { return 9; } is uncommented m.size() 
  * returns 2, when it's left commented it returns three. Why?
  * You have overidden equals without overriding hashCode. 
  * You must ensure that for all cases where equals returns true for two objects, hashCode returns the same value. 
  * The hash code is a code that must be equal if two objects are equal (the converse need not be true). 
  * When you put your hard-coded value of 9 in, you satisfy the contract again.
  * In your hash map, equality is only tested within a hash bucket. 
  * Your two Monday objects should be equal, but because they are returning different hash codes, 
  * the equals method isn't even called to determine their equality - 
  * they are put straight into different buckets, 
  * and the possibility that they are equal isn't even considered.
  * 
  * 
  *  
  * When you don't override the hashCode() method, your ToDos class inherits 
  * the default hashCode() method from Object, which gives every object a distinct hash code. 
  * This means that t1 and t2 have two different hash codes, even though were you to compare them, they would be equal. 
  * Depending on the particular hashmap implementation, the map is free to store them separately (and this is in fact what happens).
  * When you do correctly override the hashCode() method to ensure that equal objects get equal hash codes, 
  * the hashmap is able to find the two equal objects and place them in the same hash bucket.
  * A better implementation would give objects that are not equal different hash codes, like this:
  * public int hashCode() {     return (day != null) ? day.hashCode() : 0; }
